1) For the observation inputs, input the observations that you with to choose in numeric order
   with observation numbers seperated by numbers. For example, an input of 1,2,3 would have the
   program calculate vectors using observations 1, 2 and 3. On the other hand, 4,2,3 would be an 
   invalid input

2) The program will also prompt for a rho2 choice. Enter the number corresponding to the rho2
   to continue. For an example value of [(3.4, 5.6), (2.0, 6.8)], the first numbers in the tuples
   will be the r2's while the second values will be rho2's. Entering 1 would prompt the program to
   choose the 3.4 r2 value.
